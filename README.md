## Overview and Origin

* Name of company:

    Affirm

* When was the company incorporated?
	
    February 12, 2012

* Who are the founders of the company?
	
    Max Levchin, Founder & CEO, Levchin, co-founded PayPal, became CEO of Affirm in 2014. (Empowering Consumers to Live Better Financial Lives, n.d.)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    
    Affirm was started because traditional lending is not working. Companies draw in customers with the promise of “perks” which end up costing the consumer in the long run. “The average U.S. household has $6,000 in credit card debt.” (Why Affirm: Buy Now Pay Later Vs Credit Cards, n.d.)
    Affirm is based around a point-of-sale lending model which partners with merchants for distribution. Their “buy now, pay later” approach allows for transparency, flexibility, and convenience when making purchases without late or hidden fees. This option is used instead of the traditional forms of lending such as credit card use at the point of sale or unsecure personal loans through installment financing, an example being “layaway.” (Mikula, 2020) The reason for this approach, to bring change to the banking industry and provide consumers with greater control over managing their personal finances. The goal, “create honest financial products and services that empower consumers and improve lives.” 
 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    
    According to crunchbase.com, they are funded by 26 investors and have raised a total of 1.5 billion over the course of 11 funding rounds. Their most recent investors include SV Angel, GGV Capital, Baillie Gifford, and Wellington Management. (Affirm - Funding, Financials, Valuation & Investors, n.d.) 
 	Unlike traditional lending options, Affirm is given a percentage fee of the product’s sales by the merchant “in exchange for managing the payment and taking on the risk of default.” (Victor, 2021) They also charge interest on the loan, with an average APR of 18 percent. (Victor, 2021) They do not depend on the consumers staying in debt or paying late fees like credit card companies. (Why Affirm: Buy Now Pay Later Vs Credit Cards, n.d.) They are able to offer these loans through partnerships with Cross River Bank, a New Jersey State Chartered Commercial Bank, Member FDIC.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
	
    Affirm wants to allow people the ability to buy the things they want without going into uncontrollable debt. (Lake & Brock, n.d.) They aim to be upfront with customers about the amount they will pay each month with no hidden charges or unexpected changes. This is different from other payment options that have compounding interest and unexpected costs.
    They have partnered with over 2,000 merchants allowing consumers an option to pay with Affirm at checkout including well known brands in personal fitness, apparel and beauty, home furnishings, electronics and more. (Affirm, n.d.) Affirm has also created their own marketplace through the Affirm app, allowing an easy way for consumers to use Affirm as an alternative payment method while providing merchants a way to reach new customers. (Empowering Consumers to Live Better Financial Lives, n.d.)

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    
    Affirm aims to provide their services to everyone but has been adopted more readily by Gen Z and millennial consumers. This is because BNPL transactions are perceived as more transparent. “total cost is knowable upfront - this gives borrowers more of a feeling of ‘control’ vs. a credit card.” It also “maximizes convenience” enabling a consumer to complete transactions quickly therefore leading to more purchases being completed or increases in purchase size. (Mikula, 2020)
 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
	
    What makes Affirm unique is that it offers consumers the ability to choose how they will pay back the loan. The first option is “pay in 4” which splits the payments into four interest free payments every 2 weeks which is recommended for everyday purchases. The second option is monthly payments which is recommended for big ticket items. Whatever option is chosen affirm guarantees there will be no hidden fees, late fees, or unexpected charges. “The price you see is the price you pay.” (What Is Affirm? How Does Buy Now Pay Later Work?, n.d.)
    
    Purchases made through Affirm will also not affect your credit since these purchases are not directly reported to the credit bureau. (Mikula, 2020) They do this by receiving a percentage fee from the merchant in exchange for taking on the payment and any risk of default. (Victor, 2021)   

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
    
    Affirm’s Machine Learning Platform team built an Online Feature Store (OFS) using a partitioned Aurora MySQL Database. (Joseph, 2021) They use SEMrush for web traffic, Apptopia for mobile app metrics and Bombora for interest signals. There is a total of 46 technology products and services used as well as 112 additional technologies for its website including Java Script, Python, Amazon S3, Java, Amazon EC3, HTML5, Google Analytics, Google Fonts etc. (Affirm - Tech Stack, Apps, Patents & Trademarks, n.d.)

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
 	
     Affirm is considered a Third Party Lender

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    
    There have been several major trends and innovations made to the lending domain, the most significant being increased digitization through the use of financial technologies that allow for the streamlining of operations. This results in faster information collection and analysis therefore improving efficiency. “By using digital lending platforms, loan servicing takes much less time, and organizations can make decisions faster.” Due to the cost of replacing these “legacy systems” , integrative microservices are used. This allows for financial institutions to digitize their operations at their own pace. 
    
    Fintechs are also providing an alternative credit scoring system that incorporates data driven models as well as bank details. This data driven model uses behavioral data, personal data, education level, occupation, and business data. The use of this data “reduces the time and cost of servicing a loan.” By implementing machine learning and artificial intelligence, digital lending will reduce the amount of redundant tasks performed by employees and the time needed for loans to be approved since the process is primarily self-service.
    
    An additional perk of digital lending that it supports omnichannel communication - “meaning that the customer can use any channel of their choice. They can communicate using the website, the app, text messages, or even social media platforms.” This creates a more customer driven lending business. 
    
    The incorporation of blockchain technology has also quickened the approval rates of loans, managing and tracking loan payments, providing real-time transaction data, connecting borrowers to lenders, and overall, has given more control of the loan to the borrower. (Agarwal, n.d.)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
   
    Being the first company to offer consumers a buy now pay later alternative, CNBC recently named Affirm a “Top Disruptor of 2019”. Their mission to “provide honest financial products that empower consumers and improves lives” has allowed consumers to purchase items without the fear of it impacting their credit. Unlike traditional affiliates that seek to gain loyalty through the use of coupons, reward points, or cash back, The affirm app gives shoppers “spending power and immediate savings through 0% and low APR offers.” This spending power has resulted in the brands they partner with seeing increased traffic and more confident consumers completing purchases.
    
    The launch of their app has also allowed their users to split their payments at almost any location. The app prequalifies shoppers based on five simple pieces of information (name, mobile number, email address, date of birth, and the last four digits of their SSN) A decision is made within seconds without affecting their credit score. Qualified shoppers can then continue browsing and adding items to their cart and once finished, select their payment plan. 
    Through their partnership with Google Pay and Apple Pay, customers can also use the Affirm app to also make purchases at any brick-and-mortar locations that accept these payment methods. (Dani, 2019) 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    
    The key metrics Affirm focuses on are Gross Merchandise Volume ("GMV"), Active Consumers, and Transactions per Active Consumer. 
    
    They believe that GMV “is a useful operating metric to both the Company and investors in assessing the volume of transactions that take place on the Company's platform, which is an indicator of the success of the Company's merchants and the strength of that platform.”15. From June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021 their GMV has increased from 4.6 billion to 8.3 billion.
    
    The number of active consumers “is a useful operating metric to both the Company and investors in assessing consumer adoption and engagement and measuring the size of the Company's network.”15. From June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2021 the number of active consumers has increased from 2.0 million to 7.1 million. 
    
    Transactions per active consumer “is a useful operating metric to both the Company and investors in assessing consumer engagement and repeat usage, which is an indicator of the value of the Company's network.”15. From June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2021 the number of transactions per active consumer has increased from 2.0 to 2.3. (Affirm Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Results, 2021)

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    
    Affirm is one of the leaders in the “buy now pay later” industry and has benefited significantly from the shift to online consumer caused by the global pandemic. They have outpaced their other competitors at this time but this could change as more companies start implementing their own versions of BNPL. (Affirm: Increased Risk With Competitors Entering The Public Market (NASDAQ:AFRM), 2021)    

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    
    Affirms belief in providing financial freedom and empowerment aligns perfectly with the ideals of the crypto currency world. I believe by adopting the use of crypto currencies as a viable payment option it will further increase their exposure to millennials and Gen Z therefore increasing their active consumers and providing further financial control and freedom. This could also prepare for further adaptation into the Metaverse as the company continues to evolve.
